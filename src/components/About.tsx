            <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Founded in 2015, Brewster began as a small neighborhood coffee shop with a big dream: 
              to create the perfect cup of coffee while building a community of coffee lovers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Today, we continue that mission by sourcing the finest beans from sustainable farms 
              around the world, roasting them with precision, and serving them in an atmosphere 
              that feels like home.
